    <!--this is a strong paragraph-->
    <p><strong>Praise day at even, a wife when dead,
        a weapon when tried, a maid when married,
        ice when 'tis crossed, and ale when 'tis drunk.</strong></p>
    <!--This is a paragraph with emphasis-->
    <p><em>
        Hew wood in wind, sail the seas in a breeze,
        woo a maid in the dark, -- for day's eyes are many, --
        work a ship for its gliding, a shield for its shelter,
        a sword for its striking, a maid for her kiss;</em></p>
    <!--This is a bold paragraph-->
    <p><b>
        Drink ale by the fire, but slide on the ice;
        buy a steed when 'tis lanky, a sword when 'tis rusty;
        feed thy horse neath a roof, and thy hound in the yard.
    </b></p>
    <!--This is an italic paragraph-->
    <p><i>
        The speech of a maiden should no man trust
        nor the words which a woman says;
        for their hearts were shaped on a whirling wheel
        and falsehood fixed in their breasts.
    </i></p>
    <p>Breaking bow, or flaring flame,
        ravening wolf, or croaking raven,
        routing swine, or rootless tree,
        waxing wave, or seething cauldron,</p>
    <p>flying arrows, or falling billow,
        ice of a nighttime, coiling adder,
        woman's bed-talk, or broken blade,
        play of bears or a prince's child,</p>
    <p>sickly calf or self-willed thrall,
        witch's flattery, new-slain foe,
        brother's slayer, though seen on the highway,
        half burned house, or horse too swift --
        be never so trustful as these to trust.</p>
